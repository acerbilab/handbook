# Introduction

Whenever doing research, High Performance Computing (HPC) access and usage is fundamental, you will rarely be running things only on a local machine. The main HPC resources we can use are [CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/) and [UH's Turso](https://version.helsinki.fi/it-for-science/hpc/-/wikis/home).


## HPC usage tutorial
This is a [tutorial on HPC usage](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/summer-kickstart/) held in June 2021 by Aalto University, very useful. The videos are [here](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/summer-kickstart/).

[HPC user guide for UH](https://version.helsinki.fi/it-for-science/hpc/-/wikis/home). They have [support sessions](https://version.helsinki.fi/it-for-science/hpc/-/wikis/Garage) organized every dayÂ if you have any questions or need any help with HPC usage.
